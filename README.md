This is the demo code for nuvalaence excersise to list out features of two rectangles.

The features are divided into three categories:
  1. Intersection (if either of the two rectangles intersect at any boundry(s))
  2. Containment (if either of the two rectangles are entirely contained or not in the other rectangle )
  3. Adjacency (if either of the rectangles are properly adjacent, partial adjacent, sub-line adjacent or not adjacent)

  thus making the following set as our only possible universal set of answer.
   ["intersection", "no intersection", "containement", "no containement", "Adjacent(Sub-line)", "Adjacent(Proper)", "Adjacent(Parital)", "not adjacent"].

This repo was setup in Visual Stidio code. And has the following lib requirements:
1. maven libraries (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build or vscode:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
2. Junit libraries (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-testing or vscode:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
3. Java 1.8 or higher (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)

To run tests, open the cloned repo in visual studio code and hit the run button from tests explorer.
